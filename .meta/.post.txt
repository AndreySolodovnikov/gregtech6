6.09.06:
[FIXED] Screwdriver Recipes being overwritten by Axle Recipes by accident.
[FIXED] Gearboxes and Axles were not being Paintable, because I accidentially grabbed the wrong RGB Color.
[FIXED] Gears attached to the Gearboxes did not count towards the contained Materials total for recycling them.
[ADDED] The Gibbl-O-Meter can now detect the total amount of Fluid inside any Basic Machine.
[ADDED] Wrench Overlay to show which Sides of a Custom Gearbox have Gears.
[ADDED] Transformer Gearboxes, they kinda work like the Electric Transformers, just with only one instead of 5 Outputs. It's a Planetary Gear by design.
